+	- the old bg image resources are now provided by the background
+	  extension, and perl is thus required for bg image support. No
+	  configuration change is needed: urxvt autoloads the background
+	  ext if any bg image resource/option is present. The old bg image
+	  resources are also now deprecated; users are encouraged to
+	  switch to the new bg image interface (see man urxvt-background).
